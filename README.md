# Alx High Level Programming
## Description
Alx Holberton's curriculum for high-level programming include the following projects that are meant to help us learn how to use and apply the basic fundamental concepts from [low-level programming in C](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming) on a different programming language - Python.
## Requirements
  #### Python Scripts:
   * The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
   * Your code should use the [pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/) (version 2.8.*) 
   * All your files should end with a new line
   * All your files must be executable
   * All your files will be interpreted/compiled on using python3 (version 3.8.5)
  #### Shell Scripts:
   * The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
   * All your files should end with a new line
   * All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`wc -l file` should print 2)
   * All your files must be executable
  #### C Scripts:
   * You are not allowed to use global variables
   * No more than 5 functions per file
   * Your code should use the [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki) style.
   * All your files should end with a new line
   * The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `lists.h`
   * All your header files should be include guarded

> Beautiful is better than ugly.\
> Explicit is better than implicit.\
> Simple is better than complex.\
> Complex is better than complicated.\
> Flat is better than nested.\
> Sparse is better than dense.\
> Readability counts.\
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\
> Although practicality beats purity.\
> Errors should never pass silently.\
> Unless explicitly silenced.\
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\
> Now is better than never.\
> Although never is often better than *right* now.\
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\
> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
