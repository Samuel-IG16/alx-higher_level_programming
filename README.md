# Alx High Level Programming :man_technologist:
## Description
Alx Holberton's curriculum for high-level programming include the following projects that are meant to help us learn how to use and apply the basic fundamental concepts from [low-level programming in C](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming) on a different programming language - Python.

## Specifications
  #### Python Scripts:
   * The first line of all files is exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
   * The code uses the [pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/) (version 2.8.*)
   * All modules are properly documented
   * All classes are properly documented
   * All functions are properly documentated
   * All the files end with a new line
   * All the files are/should be executable
   * All the files can be interpreted/compiled on using python3 (version 3.8.5)
  #### Shell Scripts:
   * The first line of all files is exactly `#!/bin/bash`
   * All the files end with a new line
   * All the scripts are exactly two lines long (`wc -l file` should print 2)
   * All the files are/should be executable
  #### C Scripts:
   * No global variables were used
   * No more than 5 functions per file
   * The code uses the [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki) style.
   * All the files end with a new line
   * The prototypes of all functions are included in the header file called `lists.h`
   * All the header files are include guarded
  #### Python Test Cases:
   * All test files are inside a tests folder
   * All test files are text files (extension: .txt)
   * All tests are executable using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
   * All modules are properly documented
   * All functions are properly documentated
   * All the files end with a new line
  #### .txt Answer Files:
   * Only one line
   * No Shebang
   * All the files end with a new line
  #### Python Unit Tests:
   * All test files are inside a tests folder
   * Make use of the [unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/unittest.html#module-unittest)
   * All test files are python files (extension: .py)
   * All test files and folders start with test_
   * File organization in the tests folder is the same as your project: ex: for `models/base.py`, unit tests must be in: `tests/test_models/test_base.py`
   * All tests are executable using this command: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
   * Test file by file by using this command: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py`

> Beautiful is better than ugly.\
> Explicit is better than implicit.\
> Simple is better than complex.\
> Complex is better than complicated.\
> Flat is better than nested.\
> Sparse is better than dense.\
> Readability counts.\
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\
> Although practicality beats purity.\
> Errors should never pass silently.\
> Unless explicitly silenced.\
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\
> Now is better than never.\
> Although never is often better than *right* now.\
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\
> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
